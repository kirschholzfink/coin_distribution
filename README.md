# coin_distribution

This app will take different amounts of 'coins', holding diverse values,

(say, the contents of your wallet: multiple 50 ct, 20 ct, 1 â‚¬ etc. pieces.)

to then recursively generate n subsets of this set of coins, all holding the exact same sum value.

(Let's say, you'd like to distribute this money among your children, equally.)


By means of a recursive algorithm it will determine if this is possible, and if yes, show you what these subsets look like.
		
To give it a try, you can use these parameters:

Value 1 : 5 coins.

Value 3 : 3 coins.

Value 5 : 2 coins.

n : 2
