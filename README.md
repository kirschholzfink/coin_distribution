# coin_distribution

This app will take different amounts of 'coins', holding diverse values,

(say, the contents of your wallet: multiple 50 ct, 20 ct, 1 â‚¬ etc. pieces.)

and then generates n subsets of this set of coins, all holding the exact same sum value.

(Let's say, you'd like to distribute this money among your children, equally.)


It will let you know if this is possible, and if yes, show you what these subsets look like.
		
To give it a try, you may want to use these parameters:

Value 1 : 5 coins.
Value 3 : 3 coins.
Value 5 : 2 coins.
n : 2
